          with a strong foundation in building dynamic, user-friendly web
          applications. Skilled in frontend and backend technologies, I enjoy
          creating seamless digital experiences from concept to deployment.
          Alongside development, I am actively learning Data Structures and
          Algorithms (DSA) to enhance my problem-solving abilities and write
          efficient, scalable code. With a keen eye for aesthetics, I also work
          as a UI/UX Designer, crafting intuitive interfaces that blend
          functionality with visual appeal. I am driven by curiosity,
          creativity, and a commitment to continuous learning, always seeking
          opportunities to innovate and deliver impactful solutions.
